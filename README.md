# Threat-Alert-using-Raspberry-Pi.
The main aim of this project is to propose a Threat alert system using Raspberry Pi and IBM Watson Bluemix Visual Recognition. By the successful implementation of the project we were able to detect the object in the captured image. After the detection we can send a push notification to the subscribed user that there is a person with the weapon that is attacking a civilian. Here the location of the captured image is sent in the python code and as the code runs the image is sent to Watson Developer Cloud, which detects the weapon in the image. The result of the Watson Developer Cloud is shown in the output of python code. Now this output is used as input to another section of the python code which sends the detected weapon as a push notification to subscribed user using Remote Alert app. Thus, subscriber knows that there is a person with some weapon at certain place.
